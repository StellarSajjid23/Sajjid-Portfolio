Cybersecurity Enthusiast | Network Security | Python Scripting | Ethical Hacking

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! I’m an aspiring cybersecurity professional currently pursuing a Bachelor of Applied Technology in Cybersecurity at Lone Star College, with an expected graduation in Spring 2026. Certified as a Cisco CyberOps Associate and actively working towards my CompTIA Network+ and Security+ certifications, I’m passionate about securing digital environments and building resilient network infrastructures.

In addition to my academic and hands-on experience, I’ve completed Udemy’s Ethical Hacking Bootcamp, which has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of penetration testing, ethical hacking methodologies, and security tools. This has significantly enhanced my ability to identify vulnerabilities, exploit weaknesses, and apply security best practices in real-world scenarios.

My GitHub features a range of projects showcasing my skills in network security, systems administration, and automation. From building network packet sniffers and malware analysis sandboxes to developing vulnerability scanners, I leverage tools like Wireshark, Python, and Linux platforms (Ubuntu, Kali) to detect and mitigate security risks.

Key Skills:
Network Security: Configuration and troubleshooting of network infrastructure (Cisco routers, switches, VLANs, and routing protocols).

Ethical Hacking: Practical experience with penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, and using ethical hacking tools like Metasploit, Burp Suite, and Nmap.

Scripting & Automation: Python scripting for security tools and automation of security tasks.

Linux: Hands-on experience with Ubuntu and Kali Linux for security testing and analysis.

As I continue my journey in cybersecurity, I’m eager to contribute my knowledge and expertise to the broader cybersecurity community. Feel free to explore my projects, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you're interested in collaboration or have any questions.
